    [SSHD-1288] SFTP: fix reading files that are being written
    
    If data is appended while a file is read via SFTP, SftpInputStreamAsync
    would enter an infinite loop if requestOffset >= fileSize + bufferSize.
    Fix this and issue only sequential read requests once we detect that
    we're beyond the expected EOF.

    [SSHD-1289] Fix lock handling in KeyExchangeMessageHandler
    
    Make sure that a thread does not try to acquire the write lock if
    it already holds the read lock. This could happen if a write is not
    enqueued and there is an exception during writing, and we then try
    to close the session on the same thread.
    
    The read/write lock is used for three purposes: first, it gives the
    flushing thread trying to empty the queue of pending packets priority
    over other threads trying to enqueue more packets, and second, it is
    held during writeOrEnqueue() while writing a packet directly to prevent
    that the KEX state changes between being checked and the write being
    done, and third, to prevent that the KEX state changes asynchronously
    while the flushing thread is checking it. The read/write lock itself
    does not serve to ensure mutual exclusion on the KEX state itself.
    
    These three functions can also be fulfilled if update() is executed
    when only the read lock is held. If a thread in update() holds the read
    lock, this can only occur if it wrote the buffer directly in
    writeOrEnqueue(), in which case it is fine to proceed, and the flushing
    thread for sure is not in its critical region where it holds the write
    lock. Otherwise, any other thread either is the flushing thread and
    holds the write lock already, or it's a thread not holding the lock at
    all. In both cases it is fine to acquire the write lock.

    [SSHD-1281] Close Nio2Session properly on failure after connecting
    
    If there's an exception in Nio2Connector after the session was set on
    the DefaultIoConnectFuture, a program might just hang on that session
    until the next read or write attempt, or until a timeout expired.
    
    This was caused by closing the underlying connection, but not properly
    closing the already existing session, and because the session was
    already set on the future, setting the exception had no effect anymore.
    
    Fix this by immediately closing the Nio2Session properly in that case.

    Fix container tests when run from the src tgz in the distribution
    
    Running a "mvn clean install" from the source tar archive failed for
    some container tests because unpacking the tar might not preserve
    executable bits. Testcontainers need an entrypoint that is executable,
    or otherwise the entrypoint script must not be run directly but via
    a shell explicitly.
    
    Rewrite the two problematic tests to ensure the entrypoint script is
    always executable, irrespective of whether the test resource has the
    bit set.

    SSHD-1269: Fix TCP/IP remote port forwarding with wildcard addresses
    
    Remote port forwarding using an OpenSSH client and an Apache MINA sshd
    server didn't work with wildcard addresses or with "localhost". For
    instance,
    
    ssh ... -R 0.0.0.0:0:somewhere:1234
    
    would fail: the Apache MINA sshd server would send a forwarded-tcpip
    request with 127.0.0.1:55555 (if port 55555 was chosen) to OpenSSH,
    but OpenSSH expected 0.0.0.0:55555.
    
    ssh ... -R 0:somewhere:1234
    
    also failed in the same way.
    
    Fix this by sending back in the forwarded-tcpip request the original
    address with the bound port.
    
    (Note: this was already fixed by SSHD-792 as of Apache MINA sshd 2.2.0,
    but was broken again in 2.6.0. Unit tests using an Apache MINA sshd
    client to initiate the remote port forwarding didn't detect the problem
    because Apache MINA sshd only checks the port but not the hostname.)

    SSHD-1055: Half-close port-forwarded socket on EOF in tunnel
    
    Propagate an EOF on a tunnel for port forwarding to the socket by
    shutting down its output; otherwise the client connected to that
    socket may hang.
    
    For the MINA transport back-end, calling socket.shutdownOutput(), which
    is possible only via reflection, leads to problems as it confuses the
    main polling loop inside MINA. So don't do that but schedule the MINA
    session to close once all pending writes have been written.
    
    Enable half-closure in the Netty transport back-end.
    
    Fix the Nio2 transport back-end to not re-try accepting connections
    when the channel is already closing.
    
    See also SSHD-964 and SSHD-902.

    Also: don't redirect test output to a file; these files are not

    the GitHUb CI build log has much more information useful to analyze

    Asynchronous handling of global requests
    
    Handling of global requests with want-reply=true was synchronous. This
    is fine if the call is made on a non-I/O thread, but to be able to use
    global requests in I/O threads, an asynchronous handling is needed.
    
    Provide an asynchronous variant of Session.request() that returns a
    future and that takes an optional reply handler as argument. If a
    handler is given, it will be invoked by the framework once the reply
    is received, on the I/O thread that received the reply. The future can
    in this case be used to wait until the request has indeed be sent.
    Without handler, the future can be used to await the reply on some
    other thread, or to handle it via a future listener.
    
    This makes global request handling much more flexible, avoids that a
    synchronous implementation blocks an I/O thread, and it avoids problems
    with making global requests while a key exchange is ongoing.
    
    It also removes the restriction that there must be only one pending
    global request per SSH session. The implementation keeps a FIFO list
    of requests sent, and associates a reply with the front-most request
    in that list. Only requests with want-reply=true enter that list.
    
    Because of SSHD-968 we must also know the SSH message sequence number
    of each global request made with want-reply=true. The previous
    implementation assumed that the when a request was made, the next
    packet written would be that request. But that may not be true when a
    KEX is ongoing. Improve that implementation to report the sequence
    number via a callback when the request's packet is indeed sent.
    
    In AbstractSession.preClose(), fail all pending global requests.
    
    Additionally, make Session.request() also work for global requests with
    want-reply=false. Such requests can also be written directly with
    Session.writePacket(), but it seems natural and convenient for users
    of the library to also be able to use Session.request() for this.
    
    Add some fairly advanced unit tests to verify the implementation. The
    new unit tests showcase different implementations, somewhat simplified,
    of a client-side OpenSshHostKeysHandler.
    
    Add some technical documentation on global requests.

    [SSHD-1254] Client side implementation of host-bound pubkey auth
    
    Provide a KexExtensionParser for it; make the default client KEX
    extension handler understand the "publickey-hostbound@openssh.com"
    extension, and use it in UserAuthPublicKey.
    
    The extension changes the auth name in the SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
    from "pubkey" to "publickey-hostbound-v00@openssh.com" and includes
    the server's public key in the message and its signature.
    
    Includes a container test using publickey authentication to log in to
    an OpenSSH 9.0 server, verifying that the Apache MINA sshd client got
    the KEX extension and checking the server log from the container to
    verify that the server got a host-based signature.

    [SSHD-1262] Eliminate buffering in TCP/IP port forwarding
    
    TCP/IP port forwarding started reading on the local port before the SSH
    tunnel was established, i.e., before SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION
    was received. It buffered data until then, and then tried to flush the
    buffer once the confirmation was received.
    
    This didn't work if the channel window was exhausted while that buffered
    data was to be written, and in particular it failed when the channel was
    opened with an initial window size of zero.
    
    Change the whole forwarding setup: first set up the SSH tunnel, only
    then start reading from the local port. That way, no data needs to be
    buffered at all.
    
    Use a ChannelAsyncOutputStream to forward data read into the SSH tunnel;
    this nicely adapts to the channel window. To avoid concurrent writes on
    this channel, suspend reading from the local port before writing, and
    resume it only after the data was written. This automatically throttles
    reading to the speed of writing, which is what one wants in this case.
    
    Implement IOSession.suspendRead() and IOSession.resumeRead() also for
    the MINA and Netty back-ends. Fix the implementation for the NIO2
    back-end: the former implementation of resumeRead() could cause
    concurrent reads if the channel indeed did an asynchronous read, and if
    the channel did a synchronous read it led to deep completion handler
    chains on the stack, and could delay the next read on some other
    session's completion handler. Resolve this for our use-case by
    scheduling an asynchronous read explicitly if necessary, and letting
    the normal read completion handler do the read if possible.
    
    Do this also for the TcpipServerChannel: it started reading from the
    connected port before it even sent SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION.
    Remove the BufferedIoOutputStream and use a ChannelAsyncOutputStream
    always.
    
    Run the forwarding writes through ThreadUtils.runAsInternal(): the
    write might otherwise block if a KEX was on-going, but we should never
    block NIO threads. With ThreadUtils.runAsInternal(), the write may
    enqueue a packet, but the write future will be fulfilled only once this
    enqueued packet was flushed when KEX is done, so we won't read from the
    port until then and thus don't run the risk that a fast producer puts
    thousands of packets onto the internal queue during KEX.
    
    Fix a bug in AbstractChannel that became apparent with this change: when
    a peer disconnects before having sent SSH_MSG_OPEN_CONFIRMATION for a
    channel, that channel cannot be closed gracefully because the peer's id
    for it is unknown.
    
    Include technical documentation on TCP/IP port forwarding.

    Fix the Netty connection back-end
    
    Running the tests with Netty frequently resulted in failures due to
    connection time-outs. The root cause of this was a race condition
    in NettyIoConnector: if the connection succeeded and the NettyIoSession
    was initialized via channelActive() before the connector had set
    the DefaultIoConnectFuture attribute on the channel, then that future
    would never be signalled.
    
    Rewrite the NettyIoConnector to not use a global Bootstrap for all
    connections. Use a new and dedicated Bootstrap per connection. This
    makes is possible to use Bootstrap.attr() to have the channel attribute
    be set early on, before even the connection is attempted. For the
    context AttributeRepository, one then doesn't even need an attribute;
    it's available directly.
    
    Also don't set SO_BACKLOG in the connector; this socket option only
    makes sense for server sockets, i.e., in the acceptor.
    
    Enable running the sshd-core tests also with Netty.

    [SSHD-1266] OpenSSH certificates: fix encoding of critical options
    
    Option values are not encoded directly, but must be wrapped in an
    additional buffer. This would allow for an option to have multiple
    data items.
    
    Also enforce the ordering and uniqueness constraints on options.

    KEX: handle SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST and SSH_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
    
    According to RFC 4253, these two messages must not be sent during KEX.
    Queue them, or block the thread trying to send them, as appropriate.
    
    This also enables us to start flushing queued pending writes already in
    KEX state KEYS.
    
    Also accept SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST when in KEX state INIT. After having
    sent our KEX_INIT, it's possible that we receive service requests "in
    flight" before the peer's KEX_INIT. A potential service accept message
    to send back will be delayed until after the KEX. If no KEX was run yet,
    refuse the service request.
    
    Do the same also for SSH_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT.
    
    This change uncovered a bug in ClientUserAuthService, which suddenly
    sent the SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH 'none' before the SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST
    'user-auth'. This happened because SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH got written before
    the service was even started; the message got queued, and flushing the
    queue starts now before KEX state done. Until now this was hidden
    because SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST was written on the KeyEstablished event
    and was treated as a low-level message, and thus got sent before
    flushing the queue started.
    
    Fix this by delaying sending SSH_MSG_USER_AUTH until the service has
    indeed been started (and the SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST has been sent).
    
    Include some documentation on KEX.

    [SSHD-966] Flush pending packets asynchronously at end of KEX
    
    Previous code flushed them synchronously before setting KEX state to
    DONE. This could lead to deadlocks if there were exceptions and the
    session got closed while flushing.
    
    Moreover, AbstractSession.writePacket() had a race condition: after
    having determined the kex state, it was still possible that an incoming
    SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT would change the KEX state and then get the encodeLock
    and send back its answer before the first thread. In that case the
    client might have received a high-level message during KEX, which is
    forbidden by RFC 4253.
    
    Change the code to flush pending packets asynchronously. In
    writePackets, keep enqueuing packets if KEX is DONE but we're still
    flushing. To avoid keeping the flushing thread busy forever, we block
    new writes, unless they are direct replies to SSH protocol messages.
    I.e., channel data messages block the calling thread while flushing
    is still in progress.
    
    Some care has to be exercised to avoid new deadlocks. First, obviously
    a thread holding the decodeLock must not be blocked. Second, threads
    holding the futureLock must never block. Additionally, the code never
    blocks writes that occur inside a future listener.
    
    Note that while KEX is in progress (not DONE yet), an application may
    put arbitrarily many packets onto the queue (for instance, if the
    remote's channel window is large, and there's an asynchronous
    application thread pumping data through a channel). This was the case
    already before this change, and it is still the case. If there is so
    much data in the queue that a new KEX will be triggered, the new code
    will actually initiate a new KEX, flushing stops, and is resumed once
    the new KEX finishes.

    Fine-grained synchronization in ChannelOutputStream
    
    Allow closing a ChannelOutputStream asynchronously. The broad
    synchronization on the stream instance's monitor in both write() and
    flush() was the immediate cause of the deadlock reported in SSHD-966.
    
    The Apache MINA sshd framework needs to be able to asynchronously
    close a ChannelOutputStream when there are errors and the session
    is shut down on exceptions.
    
    The only synchronized method is now write(), and synchronization is
    used solely to prevent concurrent writes. The state shared between
    write() and flush() (the buffer state) is guarded separately, and is
    never locked while waiting for window adjustments or while writing.

commit 1ab50fe2faf84ec7a2d1d5658a5276ded873492c
Author: Thomas Wolf <twolf@apache.org>

    Fine-grained synchronization in ChannelAsyncOutputStream
    
    Remove the broad locking on the stream instance's monitor. Holding
    such broad locks during write operations may easily deadlock. Instead
    guard only some state fields, and make sure these are never locked
    during write operations, or when futures are fulfilled, which may
    notify arbitrary listeners, which might trigger writes.
    
    The idea of this ChannelAsyncOutputStream is to write as much of a
    buffer as possible as individual packets. When there is not enough
    window space, stop writing and let the write be resumed asynchronously
    once the window has been enlarged; then write the rest of the buffer.
    
    The implementation treats the buffer to be written as a token: while
    it is being processed, the pendingWrite field is null. This ensures
    that always only one thread is processing the buffer to write the next
    chunk. Otherwise it might be possible that an asynchronous window
    adjustment tried to process the buffer while it already was being
    written.
    
    Closing a ChannelAsyncOutputStream gracefully is tricky and may not
    always be possible, depending on the reason for closing it. If channel
    window adjustments are not handled anymore, writing the last pending
    buffer in full may not be possible if the stream is waiting for more
    window space. In that case, the stream may close with some unwritten
    data, but that is unavoidable. (The previous code had a similar problem;
    see SSHD-1261; this implementation should also solve that issue.)

    [SSHD-1264] Use the same KEX proposal for every KEX in a session
    
    The KEX proposal (algorithms and so on) is created once upon the first
    KEX, and subsequently must not be changed anymore during the session.
    Re-KEX must use the same proposal in this session, otherwise it may
    fail because suddenly a different host key might be used (if the server
    has several), or it might not be possible to negotiate algorithms when
    it was possible on the initial KEX.
    
    OpenSSH also evaluates the proposal only once per session and then
    re-uses it; only the cookie in the SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT message changes
    every time it is sent.

    KEX: change output encoding atomically
    
    Ensure the `encodeLock` is held for sending the `SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS`
    message and changing the output encoding.
    
    For the input encoding a similar change is not needed since the
    `decodeLock` is held anyway.
    
    Strictly speaking acquiring the `encodeLock` should not be necessary
    since any other potentially concurrent writes should be queued because
    the KEX state is not yet `DONE`.

    `DefaultKeyExchangeFuture.setValue()` allows setting the value only
    once. Subsequent invocations are no-ops. It is thus not necessary to

    Clean up service support
    
    Previous code declared a `SessionHelper.sessionLock` and used it in
    `AbstractSession` around `doHandleMessage()` and in `ClientSessionImpl`
    to partially guard service-related info (the service names and the next
    service) against concurrent accesses.
    
    The use of this `sessionLock` around handling messages was a way to
    synchronize access to the `currentService` field.
    
    Encapsulate the current service in a synchronized per-session
    `CurrentService` object. In `ClientSessionImpl`, install a customized
    object that also can handle switching the service (from authentication
    to connections), and set the `initialRequestSent` flag atomically.
    
    Message handling is serialized per session already via the `decodeLock`.
    Remove the locking in `AbstractSession.handleMessage()`.
    
    Note that like previous code `AbstractServerSession.startService()`
    actually does _not_ call `start()` on the service. This looks like an
    oversight, but doing so leads to flaky tests in my test runs.

    Since OutputStream.close() is a no-op when the stream is already closed

    This use in ChannelSession is the last use of this OutputStream. It

    Downgrade JGit to 5.13.0.202109080827-r
    
    As of version 6.0.0, JGit requires Java 11 to work. Apache MINA sshd
    has Java 8 as base required execution environment (BREE), so it cannot
    use JGit 6.0.0 until it also changes its BREE to Java 11 at least for
    the sshd-git bundle.

    [SSHD-1231] Updated changes tracking file

3	0	CHANGES.md

commit 126ee5cfe25b4c800a196a227d5f21175a5845e9
Author: Thomas Wolf <twolf@apache.org>
Date:   2021-12-02 00:10:34 +0100

    [SSHD-1231] Pubkey auth: reset list of signature algorithms
    
    Reset the list when a new key is tried to avoid inadvertently trying
    a remaining signature algorithm from a previous failed authentication
    attempt.
    
    The test reproduces the authentication failure (without the fix), but
    it cannot reproduce the exact exception reported in SSHD-1231. With an
    Apache MINA sshd server, the InvalidKey exception occurs on the server
    side, and the client just gets a "no more authentication methods"
    exception. This is because our server verifies the signature algorithm
    against the key type before even checking whether the key would be
    acceptable at all. (It sets up a signature verifier even if the request
    does not contain a signature.) OpenSSH checks the key against the
    authorized keys first, and thus the InvalidKey exception occurs in the
    client.

    Fix Buffer.putRawPublicKey() for hardware keys
    
    Buffer.putRawPublicKey() did not account for sk-* keys. Apache MINA
    sshd supports these keys only on the server side; so the worst effect
    was that the fingerprint was reported as "BufferException". (Supporting
    these keys on the client side would involve calling a dynamic native
    library (with address space protection, i.e., via a separate process)).
    
    Also make KeyUtils.getKeyType return the correct string for sk-* keys,
    and at least report the exception and its message in the fingerprint
    when computing the fingerprint fails.
    
    Note that Apache MINA sshd does not support the sk-* certificate key
    types yet.

    SFTP: support file timestamps with sub-millisecond resolution
    
    Refactor the reading and writing of FileTimes to avoid manual nanosecond
    calculations. Go through Instant instead. On writing, this may saturate,
    but for times that far in the past or future nanos are irrelevant. On
    reading, drop nanos if the value would be outside the range of Instant.
    
    The advantage of doing it this way is that we can actually report and
    recover sub-millisecond timestamps (for SFTP version >= 4). Newer Java
    does report file timestamps with the OS resolution (100ns on Windows/
    NTFS, may be even lower on other OSes depending on the file system).

    [SSHD-704] Fix DH KEX for curve25519 and enable curve25519 and curve448
    
    Simplify MontgomeryCurve, take advantage of the fact that the key is
    always the last 32 or 56 bytes of the X.509 DER encoding. Add extensive
    comments about the "magic" constants. Be more strict about key data
    with an extra leading zero byte.
    
    Enable the new KEX algorithms in BaseBuilder.
    
    At that point, curve25519 KEX worked only if both the client's and the
    server's ephemeral public keys byte arrays did not have the most
    significant bit in the first byte set. This uncovered a bug in DHGClient
    and DHGServer: ECDH and XDH KEX encode Q_C and Q_S as plain byte arrays,
    not as multi-precision integers. I.e., they _do not_ prefix a zero byte
    if the high bit in the first byte of the value is set.
    
    Fix this by introducing AbstractDH.putE(Buffer) and putF(Buffer)
    methods, so that individual DH implementations can override as
    appropriate. Override them for ECDH and XDH to write byte arrays, not
    mpints.
    
    * RFC 4253, section 8:[1] encodes e and f as mpint.
    * RFC 5656, section 4:[2] Q_C and Q_S, which take the place of e and f,
      are written as "strings" (byte arrays).
    * RFC 8731, section 3:[3] Public ephemeral keys are written as strings.
    
    With these changes, KEX using curve25519 works, and KEX using one of
    the other already existing algorithms also still works.

    [SSHD-1221] Support key constraints when adding a key to the SSH agent
    
    Change the API of SshAgent.addKeyToAgent() to be able to pass key
    constraints. Provide default implementations for the documented
    OpenSSH constraints: confirm, lifetime, and the sk-provider extension.
    
    Handle them in the AbstractAgentProxy implementation. Note that
    AbstractAgentProxy currently implements addKeyToAgent() only for
    OpenSSH. Users wanting to support a different agent may have to
    implement different constraints by extending the provided base classes,
    and may have to provide their own SshAgent (and a factory for it)
    implementing a different protocol for addKeyToAgent().

    [SSHD-1220] Cache SFTP attributes on SftpPaths
    
    This greatly reduces the number of (L)STAT calls made to get SFTP
    attributes. Also, listing directories in reply to SSH_FXP_OPENDIR
    and SSH_FXP_READDIR can in this way still go through the normal
    `java.nio.file.FileSystem` abstraction. There is no need anymore to
    bypass the file system to resolve SSHD-1217.
    
    The attributes cached on the `Path` objects returned from the
    `DirectoryStream` are used only for listing the directory. This
    is a similar optimization as was done in the Java libraries for
    a `FileTreeWalker` operating on an Unix file system, which may use
    cached attributes via the internal interface
    `sun.nio.fs.BasicFileAttributesHolder`.
    
    Caching is also enabled selectively in the up-front checks for file
    accessibility, which also caused repeated (L)STAT calls. Rewrite
    `IoUtils.checkFileExists()` to load attributes only once.
    
    The new operations for caching attributes on `SftpPath` instances are
    not intended to be used by client code. For access in the SFTP
    implementation itself, paths are now always created as `SftpPathImpl`
    instances, which inherit from `SftpPath` and publish a safe
    `withAttributeCache()` method. Theoretically client code could
    still access these methods, but then it's clear for everyone that these
    are internal operations.

    Set an attribute on the ClientSession. Since commit 14b4ec07, the

    obtain this value from the session. It needs to know this value to be
    able to connect to the correct SSH agent.
    
    Also change the handling of SSH agents when IdentitiesOnly is set. Do
    not hard-code skipping an agent completely if the value is true. The
    value is also available via the ClientSession; hence just let the
    factory decide what it should do in that case. This is more flexible
    for users of the library.

    only very slowly.
    
    This was caused by the SFTP server implementation using Java FileSystem
    abstractions itself for listing directories. Using java.nio.file.Files,
    it ended up doing essentially the following when receiving a
    SSH_FXP_READDIR command:
    
    ```
    try(DirectoryStream<Path> list = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir)) {
      Map<Path, BasicFileAttributes> toSend = new HashMap<>();
      list.iterator().forEach(p ->
        toSend.put(p, Files.readAttributes(p, BasicFileAttributes.class))
      );
      replyToClient(SSH_FXP_NAME, toSend);
    };
    ```
    (Not literally. This omits a lot of special handling for empty
    directories, not sending too large messages back to the client, and
    so on. But ultimately it boiled down to the above.)
    
    That is fine when the server-side file system from which files are
    served is local on the server. But when that file system itself is
    a remote file system, `newDirectoryStream` is a remote call sending
    SSH_FXP_OPENDIR and SSH_FXP_READDIR to the upstream server, and
    additionally each of these `readAttributes()` calls is yet another
    remote call sending SSH_FXP_LSTAT. This slows down getting the
    directory listing to the client tremendously.
    
    The most annoying part of all this is that the SSH_FXP_READDIR to the
    upstream SFTP server in `newDirectoryStream` _already returned all the
    attributes_, but this is lost because the Java NIO File abstractions
    have no real support for getting a directory listing including
    attributes in one fell swoop. (No, using a FileVisitor and
    Files.walkFileTree with depth 1 wouldn't help.)
    
    So detect this case in the server's SftpSubsystem, and bypass the Java
    FileSystem abstraction if the file system is itself an SftpFileSystem.
    Simply issue SSH_FXP_READDIR requests and forward the whole reply, which
    includes file names and attributes, directly to the client. For reading
    a directory containing 2000 files, this eliminates 10040 SSH_FXP_LSTAT
    calls; only the directory itself is stat'ed.
    
    A corollary to this is that clients in general should avoid listing
    directories on an SftpFileSystem via java.nio.file.Files _if they also
    need the file attributes_. Instead do
    
    ```
    SftpFileSystem fs = ...;
    try (SftpClient client = fs.getClient();
         CloseableHandle dir = client.openDir(remDirPath)) {
      for (SftpClient.DirEntry entry : client.listDir(dir)) {
        Path path = dir.getFile().resolve(entry.getFilename());
        SftpClient.Attributes = entry.getAttributes();
        // Do whatever you need with it
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Implementation note: another idea is to cache the attributes read in
    SSH_FXP_READDIR in `newDirectoryStream` on the Path objects returned,
    and make `readAttributes` return these cached attributes while the
    stream is not closed yet. Technically, this is doable; it'd be a hack
    similar to what Java's own UnixFileSystem does (and FileVisitor takes
    advantage of it). However, it would break some edge cases, like a
    client writing to one of the files during the directory stream
    iteration, and then reading the attributes again and expecting the
    new attributes but still getting the cached ones.
    
    Side note: the SFTP protocol has no command to get _only_ a listing
    of names. SSH_FXP_READDIR _always_ returns both names and attributes.

    Allow using an SSH agent without agent forwarding
    
    It's quite possible to use an SSH agent without agent forwarding.
    Apache MINA sshd should not require ChannelForwardingFactories being
    implemented by the SshAgentFactory. If it does, fine; if it does not,
    it's also fine and agent forwarding will simply not be available.
    
    Agent forwarding comes with a well-known security risk: root on the
    server could abuse the forwarded agent. Using the more modern
    ProxyJump feature it's possible to connect through jump hosts without
    agent forwarding (and without needing to put keys onto the jump host).
    
    So give users the option of providing an SshAgentFactory that only
    implements createClient(), but that returns null or an empty list from
    getChannelForwardingFactories().

    Set output and input encodings separately at end of KEX
    
    Once SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is sent any subsequent packet sent must use the
    new encoding settings. Once SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is received, the new
    encoding settings are to be used for any message received. So set the
    cipher/mac/compression separately for outgoing and incoming messages
    in sendNewKeys() and handleNewKeys().
    
    Previously, we set both only in handleNewKeys(), i.e., when the peer's
    SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS was received. This makes implementing a KEX extension
    handler more complicated than necessary since it had to delay sending
    the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO packet until after the peer's SSH_MSG_NEW_KEYS was
    received.
    
    RFC 8308 recommends that "the server sends its SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO not
    only as the next packet after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, but without delay". This
    is now possible since the output settings are already set up correctly.
    
    SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO is always sent and received after SSH_MSG_NEWKEY, and
    the Apache MINA sshd implementation guarantees that either party handles
    the peer's SSH_MSG_NEWKEY *after* having sent its own SSH_MSG_NEWKEY.

    [SSHD-1216] Server-side server-sig-algs KEX extension
    
    Provide a default implementation for the server-side SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO
    message sending including the server-sig-algs KEX extension.[1]
    
    A server that implements the rsa-sha2-512 or rsa-sha2-256 signature
    algorithms should implement this extension, otherwise even clients that
    also have these signature algorithms may fall back to ssh-rsa to avoid
    authentication penalties.[2]
    
    Apache MINA sshd servers by default do implement the SHA-2 RSA
    signatures, and an Apache MINA sshd client by default does request KEX
    extension information and does handle the server-sig-algs extension. So
    an Apache MINA sshd server should by default implement this extension.
    
    This implementation sends the server-sig-algs extension record once at
    the end of the initial key exchange.

    [SSHD-1215] Treat ACE4_APPEND_DATA as a hint only
    
    Some SFTP clients in SFTP version >= V5 set the NFS desired-access flag
    ACE4_APPEND_DATA even when they only open the file for normal write
    access. SFTP append mode should be active only if the file is indeed
    opened with one of the "append" options SSH_FXF_APPEND or
    SSH_FXF_APPEND_DATA or SSH_FXF_APPEND_DATA_ATOMIC.
    
    The SFTP draft RFCs appear to allow the combination of SSH_FXF_READ,
    SSH_FXF_WRITE, and SSH_FXF_APPEND, which would open the file for reading
    and writing, all writes going to the current end of the file. POSIX
    also allows the combination O_RDWR | O_APPEND. But Java complains about
    using both StandardOpenOption.READ and StandardOpenOption.APPEND.
    Therefore never open files in Java with StandardOpenOption.APPEND but
    always manage the "append" logic explicitly. Internally, make sure that
    ACE4_APPEND_DATA is set only if the user/client had indeed requested
    "append" mode.

    [SSHD-1188] SFTP: add a test for renaming a file
    
    If the target already exists, a plain rename must fail. For SFTP >= V5,
    a rename with CopyMode.Overwrite shall succeed. Note that the behavior
    with CopyMode.Atomic is platform dependent; it's mapped internally to
    java.nio.file.Files.move() with StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE, for
    which the javadoc says
    
    "If the target file exists then it is implementation specific if
    the existing file is replaced or this method fails by throwing an
    IOException."
    
    This is fine; the SFTP RFC draft, version 13, allows this behavior for
    atomic renames.[1]

    Setting the flags to SSH_FXF_READ if they're zero must be done only
    for SFTP < V5. For >= V5, zero is a valid value indicating
    SSH_FXF_CREATE_NEW, whereas SSH_FXF_READ (< V5, value 1) is the same as
    SSH_FXF_CREATE_TRUNCATE (>= V5, value 1).

    [SSHD-1197] Fix race condition in KEX
    
    There was a window in AbstractSession.requestNewKeyExchange()
    during which the KEX state was set already to INIT, but the
    caller's proposal not set yet. If the peer had also decided to
    start a new key exchange, it was possible that the peer's KEX_INIT
    message arrived and was handled in that window and then proceeded
    with wrong or uninitialized data.
    
    KEX negotiation must start only when both proposals are indeed
    available. Thus wait when having received a KEX_INIT from the peer
    until our own proposal has been prepared before continuing with the
    negotiation.
    
    There's a new CoreModuleProperties.KEX_PROPOSAL_SETUP_TIMEOUT property
    for controlling the timeout for this waiting. Since it's used at a
    moment when there is already a thread running to prepare our proposal,
    we should never have to wait for long; the property should be set to a
    reasonably high value such that the timeout is never hit. A minimum
    value for this timeout of 5 seconds is enforced.

    [SSHD-1191] Abstract session: correct rekey block count limit
    
    Follow the recommendation from RFC 4344: if the cipher block size
    is smaller than 16, re-key after 1GB of data.[1] Otherwise, we'd
    re-key far too often; for instance with a block size of 8 after 64k
    blocks, i.e., after 512kB of data. Note that chacha20-poly1305 has
    a block size of 8.
    
    OpenSSH uses the same implementation.[2]

    ScpTests with JSch would hang sometimes, waiting in vain for an ACK.
    With JSch, one has to set up the input/output streams for a ChannelExec
    *before* connecting, otherwise it's apparently possible that one misses

    Add an enum for the certificate type (user/host), and a type
    CertificateOption for the "critical options" and "extensions" that
    can be stored in a certificate. Add new put/get methods to Buffer for
    this new CertificateOptions type.
    
    Fix a subtle bug observed in KeyUtils mapping data, where order
    matters for discovery in a few places.
    
    Add javadoc to the OpenSshCertificate methods.
    
    Make tests also verify that signatures on generated certificates can
    be verified, and add a new test that compares generated certificates
    against ones that were created by OpenSSH.

commit 47620d4722c2a3f98958a7268cdff9285ebf4408

    Minor fix in DefaultClientKexExtensionHandler
    
    Don't put the "ext-info-c" onto the KexProposalOption.SERVERKEYS
    name list. That's the server host key (signature) algorithms and it's
    the wrong list. It belongs onto KexProposalOption.ALGORITHMS (the key
    method list). AbstractSession.resolveSessionKexProposal() puts it
    there already, and AbstractSession.negotiate() checks for it.

    Add checks that only host key certificates are used for host keys, and
    only client certificates are used in pubkey authentication.
    
    Also check the validity of the certificate in the server's
    UserAuthPublicKey.

    [SSHD-1171] Re-generate OpenSSH certificates without expiration
    
    Previously these certificates had an expiration date of April 6, 2030.
    This would have made tests fail after that date, and actually hid bug
    SSHD-1172.
    
    Adapt the OpenSSHCertificateTest to check the expected exception
    message. This makes the test catch possible errors like comparing
    certificate timestamps as signed integers (because we always check
    expiration before checking principals).

    [SSHD-1161] Test for client certificate pubkey authentication
    
    Add a unit test exercising authentication with all supported *-cert
    key types against a real OpenSSH server run in a docker container.
    
    The OpenSSH server runs in an Alpine container and is primed with two
    host keys, selectable via an environment variable, and two users. It
    supports pubkey and password authentication.
    
    The test case uses org.testcontainers to build a cached docker image
    and to run and teardown the docker container instance. The test uses
    the Apache MINA sshd client using client certificate keys to
    authenticate at the OpenSSH server in the docker container.
    
    The test is not run with the mina and netty back-ends; testcontainers
    has problems resolving files when run from the re-usable test JAR. It
    also isn't run on Windows; GitHub actions Windows Server VM's don't
    have Docker (Linux) support.
    
    Also note that the test makes sure that the real BouncyCastle security
    provider is installed; testcontainers contains a shaded BC copy that
    may fail at runtime due to being unsigned.

    [SSHD-1161] Enable client certificate public key authentication
    
    Drop the restriction to host keys only in OpenSshCertificate.
    
    Add comparison of OpenSshCertificate taking into account the public
    key of the certificates, their serial number, and their signatures.
    
    Add a signature algorithm map to be able to choose the correct
    signature algorithm name during pubkey authentication.

    [SSHD-1141] Pubkey auth: handle failure with known signature algorithm
    
    If the server had announced via server-sig-algs which signature
    algorithms it supports, UserAuthPubKey tries the known algorithms
    first. If authentication with such a known signature algorithm fails,
    there is no point trying other algorithms.
    
    Trying different signature algorithms may make sense only if the client
    doesn't know which algorithms the server supports.

    [SSHD-1147] SftpInputStreamAsync: get file size before SSH_FXP_OPEN
    
    IBM's Sterling B2B SFTP connector may limit some files to be downloaded
    only once. The mechanism they use assumes that once a file has been
    opened, it'll be read and closed without any other SFTP requests being
    made on the same handle in between.
    
    Get the file size via SSH_FXP_STAT before opening the file instead of
    using SSH_FXP_FSTAT on the handle obtained from opening the file. That
    way it should be possible to download such files from such an off-spec
    SFTP server.

    [SSHD-1141] Tolerate SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK with wrong algorithm

commit cb385742bf0962cbfcda011d7c4a89aa6ab7716a
Author: Thomas Wolf <twolf@apache.org>
Date:   2021-03-23 19:51:41 +0100

    [SSHD-1141] Tolerate SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK with wrong algorithm
    
    SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK is supposed to say "the server will accept the
    key and signature algorithm the client sent in the previous
    SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message". It is _not_ intended as a mechanism
    for the server to override the client's choice of algorithm.
    
    See RFC 4252.[1]
    
    Just log a warning if a server sends back an unexpected "algorithm".
    (Github's SSH-2.0-babeld-383743ad was found to reply "ssh-rsa" even
    if the client requested "rsa-sha2-512" and the server had previously
    announced via server-sig-algs that it supports rsa-sha2-512. Subsequent
    authentication with rsa-sha2-512 then still works.)
    
    Of course the returned public key must still match exactly.
    
    The client always uses the signature algorithm that it had announced
    it would use.

    [SSHD-1141] Fix client-side server-sig-algs handling
    
    Unconditionally announce that the client wants to get the server's
    SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO. Otherwise the server will never send it. Add the
    "ext-info-c" marker only on the very first key exchange proposal,
    and make sure the client doesn't send by mistake "ext-info-s".
    
    KexExtensions are available in all phases except PREKEX.
    
    When server-sig-algs is received, reorder the client session's
    signature factories such that algorithms the server announced as
    supported come first, followed by those not announced, both in client
    order.
    
    The client determines the order and the server just says what it
    supports.
    
    Note that per RFC 8308 [1] it's possible that a server doesn't announce
    _all_ the algorithms it supports, and a client is allowed to try
    unsupported algorithms, but may face authentication penalties such
    as back-off delays, authentication failures, or disconnections.

    Some keys (RSA) may have several signature algorithms (rsa-sha2-512,

    the next key only if no attempt was successful.

    [SSHD-506] Fix incrementing the invocation_counter part of the IV used in GCM cipher.
    
    Since the invocation_counter part of the IV is treated as a uint64,
    guarding against overflow by using Math.addExact() would incorrectly
    throw an ArithmeticException when it hits Long.MAX_VALUE.

    [SSHD-1050] Fix race conditions with early access to AuthFuture
    
    Make ClientSessionImpl.authFuture volatile since it may be accessed by
    different threads without synchronization.
    
    Remove the initial dummy AuthFuture that served only to record an early
    exception, and to provide a correct session state in waitFor() when KEX
    was done but auth() not called yet.
    
    Record exceptions from signalAuthFailure() in a list if there's no
    AuthFuture yet. Introduce a lock for guarding the authFuture field and
    this new list of exceptions together.
    
    The access in updateCurrentSessionState() must remain unsynchronized
    because it occurs while the futureLock is held. Synchronizing there
    on errorLock might introduce a lock inversion between that access in
    updateCurrentSessionState() (lock order futureLock-errorLock), but
    the call to authService.auth() inside ClientSessionImpl.auth() has the
    potential to also access the futureLock is there was a previous future,
    which might give the lock order errorLock-futureLock.
    
    Listeners futures are always called outside the future's lock, so even
    if a listener calls auth() or signalAuthFailure(), this will
    not cause a lock inversion.

    [SSHD-984] Writing keys in modern OpenSSH format
    
    Add support for writing keys in the modern OpenSSH key format using
    the OpenBSD bcrypt KDF for writing passphrase-protected, encrypted
    private keys.
    
    Add a new OpenSSHKeyPairResourceWriter using a specialized
    OpenSSHKeyEncryptionContext to make the number of KDF rounds
    configurable and to have the passphrase as a char[] instead of as a
    String. Introduce a new SecureByteArrayOutputStream.
    
    Includes test cases that generate various keys, write them to files,
    and load them again. Since this only tests that Apache MINA sshd can
    work with these keys, I've also manually verified that command-line
    OpenSSH can use keys generated and written by Java to actually connect
    to an SSH server.

commit ec48d8b690f7e72b6e8a67303af714681dc640c0
Author: Guillaume Nodet <gnodet@apache.org>
Date:   2015-07-16 15:06:23 +0200

    [SSHD-326] Fix for bug in DefaultSftpClient#write(String)
    
    Previously, DefaultSftpClient#write(String) returned an OutputStream that had a
    bug in OutputStream#write(byte[],int,int): Since off was never updated, anything
    copied into the buffer was from the first 32 KiB of the array passed as first
    argument.
    
    This commit also makes sure that the OutputStream returned by
    DefaultSftpClient#write(String) performs a flush on close().

    SSHD-254 Suppress 'Authentication with partial success' message on standard authentication
    
    Version 0.9.0 incorrectly sends back a 'partial success true' flag when a client requests
    authentication using the "none" method.

    SSHD-253 Improve performance on ServerSession auth and idle timeout checks.
    
    Refactoring of the way ServerSession checks for auth and idle timeouts. The
    original version was creating, scheduling and unscheduling many Runnable
    instances while the ServerSession is active. This refactored version creates an
    'idle ping' Runnable that checks each of the currently running ServerSessions
    for timeouts. This check is run once every second.

    Support keepalive@lag.net from paramiko client
    
    The paramiko python SSH client sends "keepalive@lag.net" for its
    keepalive requests.  Like the OpenSSH client, it just wants a
    reply failure.  We don't need to log it in the server error logs.

    SSHD-19: Avoid NullPointerException when sftp is disabled
    
    If a subsystem is disabled the server won't be able to create
    the subsystem command object and initialize it into the channel.
    A SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE is returned to the client, but the
    client may have already started to send data for this command.
    
    In the case of the sftp there is an initial data packet
    sent by the client immediately behind the channel request,
    so the ChannelSession needs to consume this requset even if it
    no subsystem command was created.  Eventually the client will
    receive the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE that was sent, and tear down
    the connection with a failure message.

    SSHD-73: Avoid infinite loop when the window is full
    
    If the window has no more free space, we can't flush any more data
    until we receive a window adjust from the peer and get more space.
    
    If we still have data to write, but there is no data in our local
    buffer, we can't rely on flush() to wait for the window to get more
    free space.  Calling flush would do nothing, and we'd spin in a hard
    loop without releasing the processor until the window adjust came in.
    
    Instead of spinning, fall sleep on the Window until there is at
    least one byte free for us to write into.
    
    The only way for this case to arise is for both lastSize and
    bufferLength to be equal to 0, and for the Window to have no space.
    This can only happen if the application has written sufficient data
    to one OutputStream (stdout or SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA) to cause the
    Window to have no space, and then it performs the first write on
    the other OutputStream (stderr or SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA).
    
    This can happen if the first stream throws an exception, and the
    application catches it and tries to print the stack trace to the
    second stream.
    
    When the 2nd output stream starts its first write, both lastSize and
    bufferLength are 0 as we have never sent a packet from this stream.
    We spin hard in the write-flush loop, and never actually fall asleep
    to wait for the window adjust.

    Correctly compute the lastSize member in ChannelOutputStream
    
    If we have to split the current Buffer, because its too large for
    the session's window or packet size, don't give ourselves a credit
    equal to the left over portion.  Instead use the actual number of
    bytes we transmit inside of flush.
    
    However, because we know the new Buffer needs to hold at least
    a certain size, we can allocate it in advance to that target,
    to avoid needing to grow it while doing the split.

    SSHD-73: Remove pointless newBuffer during flush
    
    During flush we invoke newBuffer() to ensure that the Buffer we pass
    down into the outgoing encode and transmit queue is independent of
    the Buffer we continue to use for subsequently written data.
    
    However, there is no need to invoke newBuffer() again at the end
    of the flush method.
    
    If the method completes normally, the loop broke out because the
    bufferLength member is equal to 0, which means the current Buffer
    instance is in use only by ourselves, and is empty.  We don't need
    to allocate yet another empty Buffer to replace it.
    
    If the method crashes due to an exception, we have only two cases
    to worry about:
    
      case 1:  before the newBuffer call
    
      In this case, the only state changes we have done is to write
      the current buffer length into the existing Buffer instance.
      Nobody else has our Buffer.  If we crash with a RuntimeException
      during this phase and come back here again during a future write
      we'll just overwrite the same section with a new length.
    
      case 2:  after the newBuffer call
    
      After the newBuffer invocation we could crash while trying to
      send the old Buffer out.  We've already replaced the Buffer with
      a fresh one, so all that happens is the old Buffer gets garbage
      collected, possibly causing a gap in the application data stream.
    
    So this use of newBuffer during the finally is unnecessary and
    is not needed to ensure our future instance state is sane if an
    exception occurs.

    SSHD-8: Secure the agent socket against race conditions
    
    Binding a UNIX domain socket creates the socket file with the
    current umask.  This may permit evil members of the caller's group
    to connect to the socket before the listening process can mark it
    as accessible only by the owner.
    
    Instead, create a temporary directory that is accessible only to
    the owner, and only after the location is locked down, create the
    socket within it as a unique random name.

    MINA SSHD builds against Java 1.5, but setReadable(boolean,boolean)
    isn't available until Java 1.6.  Since this code path is only used
    when tomcat-jni is loaded and initialized we can use the native
    code available within the library to call chmod() on UNIX for us.

    SSHD-8: agent forwarding
    
    The main change in this commit is the switch from mina as the transport mechanism to plain tomcat/apr sockets mostly because the mina apr transport does not support the unix domain sockets.  This allow to interact with the openssh agent on unix platforms, and this also secure the agent correctly.

commit 220a60da7c5b4a2b1611cc0973c58b80bebd111c

    SSHD-54: Use OS default receive buffer to improve throughput
    
    MINA itself is actually forcing the receive buffer size to be 1024
    bytes, rather than the operating system default.  By default the
    NioAcceptor is created with a DefaultSocketSessionConfig [1] which
    sets both the send and receive buffer sizes to 1024 bytes.
    
    NioSocketAcceptor [2] then turns around and sets this receive
    buffer size into the accept socket, so all child sockets created
    for incoming connections inherit this low default value.
    
    However, in the case of the send buffer, because the configured
    value of 1024 matches the default of 1024 for the send buffer,
    doSetAll [3] never actually changes the send buffer size away from
    the operating system default.
    
    Unfortunately this means we have the following situation for our
    NIO based sockets:
    
           MINA  | OS Default
          +------+-----------
      RCV | 1024 | 43690
      SND | 8192 |  8192
    
    So the receive buffer size under MINA is 42x smaller than the OS
    default.  But the send buffer size is the OS default, as MINA does
    not directly set the send buffer size itself.  So send throughput
    is actually reasonable, but receive throughput is horrible.
    
    There is a good article [4] which explains how these settings impact
    connection throughput.  If we want any decent TCP/IP throughput we
    need reasonably large buffers to increase the amount of data one
    side can send before stopping and waiting for an ACK from the peer.
    If our receive window is only 1024 bytes, our peer can't even send
    a full TCP/IP packet on Ethernet without stopping and waiting for
    an ACK from us.
    
    Of course one could try to argue that the MINA default of 1024 bytes
    for the receive buffer is suitable, especially on a server with a
    very large number of idle connections, or connections where a human
    is typing all of the input data. But it is not suitable for a high
    traffic data receiver, like the scp command.
    
    Unfortunately asking applications to raise the receive buffer size
    on each individual connection through the SessionFactory doesn't
    work on all platforms.  On Linux with OpenJDK 6 the following
    application code appears to work:
    
      setSessionFactory(new SessionFactory() {
          @Override
          protected ServerSession createSession(final IoSession io)
              throws Exception {
              final SocketSessionConfig c = (SocketSessionConfig) io.getConfig();
              c.setKeepAlive(keepAlive);
              c.setReceiveBufferSize(43690);
            }
        }
      });
    
    but the aggregate throughput is still horrible (3 MB/s).  So the
    receive buffer didn't actually increase with the peer.
    
    Linux seems to be capping the connection at the upper bound when
    the connection starts.  If we set the receive buffer size of the
    NioSocketAcceptor to 43690, later drop the receive buffer size of
    the individual connection to 1024 in the session factory, we can
    later boost it when a specific command starts, and performance
    behaves as expected.
    
    To match developer expectations we now reset the receive buffer
    size to the operating system's default size before the server
    starts accepting connections.  This allows applications to get good

    Filter agent and X11 port forwarding requests
    
    Some server embeddings might not want to permit agent or X11 port
    forwarding from clients, as they could consume limited server
    resources like listen sockets that will never receive an inbound
    connection.  Although less risky to the host server than TCP/IP
    port forwarding, some embedders still don't want a client to be
    able to request and consume these resources.
    
    Rename the TcpIpForwardFilter to just ForwardingFilter and add
    methods to validate permission to forward the agent and X11.

    Aggressively flush during write if the buffer is full
    
    Instead of queuing up all data until the next flush() call made
    by the application, queue data until we reach either the allowed
    packet size or the current free window space, whichever limit is
    encountered first.  As soon as buffer reaches either capacity,
    send it immediately to the peer.
    
    By sizing the buffer during write() to fit the available window
    space we significantly reduce the chances that a buffer split and
    copy is needed during flush().  However, a buffer split could still
    occur if different threads are writing to two different streams on
    the same channel (e.g. one thread is writing to the stdout stream
    and a different thread is writing on the stderr stream).
    
    During write() we give ourselves a credit equal to the size of
    the last packet we successfully wrote out of this channel stream.
    This allows the application producer to race ahead of the network
    handshake by one packet and produce more data while waiting for
    the handshake to free up window space.

commit 6eb0d74ca1f4ecfb829cb914d748dbd471768da3
Author: Shawn Pearce <spearce@apache.org>
Date:   2009-12-15 03:56:32 +0000

    Allocate the next ChannelOutputStream buffer sized to last buffer
    
    If an output stream has just received a large burst of data from
    the application, its buffer will have needed to grow beyond the
    default buffer size of 512 bytes.  Its quite likely that there will
    be even more data from the application, filling the next buffer
    up to approximately the same size before we are forced to trigger
    another flush.  So allocate the next buffer sized to hold the last
    packet's complete length, or the data remaining if we had to split
    the buffered packet to fit into the available window space.
    
    Unfortunately most uses of createBuffer don't care about the size
    of the buffer, as they are one-shot requests which are often within
    the default size of 512 bytes.  Pass in 0 for these and allow them
    to use the default 512 byte size.

    Skip LoggingFilterOutputStream if logging is disabled
    
    If the log channel isn't enabled at trace level when the streams
    are being constructed, don't wrap them in LoggingFilterOuputStream
    as it wastes CPU time to go through the unnecessary method dispatch
    during write just to figure out we don't really need to be here.
    
    Unfortunately this makes it impossible to dynamically enable the
    trace logging, but given how verbose tracing would be on a running
    server with multiple connections its likely not very valuable to
    permit turning trace on dynamically without having a per-connection
    filter to control which sessions are traced, and which are not.

commit 16a1c151153eb6bf8d0c5550bc5b4bbdca5954b5
Author: Shawn Pearce <spearce@apache.org>
Date:   2009-11-17 15:35:36 +0000

    Treat invalid port forwarding as administratively prohibited
    
    A client may request a port outside of the range [0, 65535] as
    the protocol uses a 32 bit integer to transfer the port number.
    Any value outside of the standard range causes InetSocketAddress
    to throw IllegalArgumentException, so trap the exception and fail
    with the return code SSH_OPEN_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED.
    
    We might be running with a SecurityManager enabled and be denied
    access to the host's resolved IP address.  If this occurs we will
    also now catch the SecurityException and convert it into the same
    SSH_OPEN_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED return code.
